# -PWM-signls-in-Arduino
using Arduino &amp;  Proteus
Design a PWM signal generator using Arduino Uno and Timer1. The PWM signal should have a frequency of 1 kHz and a duty cycle that can be adjusted from 0% to 100% in 10% increments. Provide the Arduino code to achieve this and explain how Timer1 is configured to generate the PWM signal.
